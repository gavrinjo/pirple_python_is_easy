Info about my favorite song. AC/DC - 'You Shook Me All Night Long'
All information are took from Wikipedia.

Also i took a liberty to make a dictionary and do a for loop iterate through 'key', 'value' pairs.

'You Shook Me All Night Long' is a song by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, from the album Back in Black.
The song also reappeared on their later album Who Made Who.
It is AC/DC's first single with Brian Johnson as the lead singer, replacing Bon Scott who died of alcohol poisoning in February 1980.
It reached number 35 on the USA's Hot 100 pop singles chart in 1980.

The re-released single in 1986 contains the B-side(s): B1. "She's Got Balls" (Live, Bondi Lifesaver '77); B2. "You Shook Me All Night Long" (Live '83 â€“ 12-inch maxi-single only).
